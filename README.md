Restaurant Page is a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to create a webpage for a restaurant using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Webpack bundler.

- The main points I've learned after working on this project is to use webpack to create a basic website, dividing my Javascript logic into multiple files so that it's easier to read and understand.
